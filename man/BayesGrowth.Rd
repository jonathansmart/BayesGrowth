\description{
A package to estimate fish length-at-age models using MCMC analysis with 'rstan' models.

Estimate fish length-at-age models using MCMC analysis with
'rstan' models. This package allows a multimodel approach to growth fitting
to be applied to length-at-age data and is supported by further analyses to
determine model selection and result presentation. The core methods of this
package are presented in Smart and Grammer (2021) "Modernising fish and
shark growth curves with Bayesian length-at-age models". PLOS ONE 16(2):
  e0246734.
