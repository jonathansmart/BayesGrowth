\usage{
Calculate_MCMC_growth_curve(
  obj,
  Model = NULL,
  max.age = NULL,
  probs = c(0.5, 0.75, 0.95)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{obj}{An output from the Estimate_MCMC_Growth function}

\item{Model}{The model used in the Estimate_MCMC_Growth object. Either "VB", "Gom" or "Log".}

\item{max.age}{The max age to estimate growth up until.}

\item{probs}{The percentiles of the results to return. Can be a single value or a vector of
values. A single quantile width is required rather than its range. For example, 50th
percentiles would be width = .5 which would return a lower percentile at .25 and an upper
percentile of .75.}
}
\value{
A tibble that has been formatted using  tidybayes::mean_qi(). This includes
    variables: Age, LAA, .lower, .upper, .width, .point and .interval.
}
\description{
A 'stan.fit' object produced from Estimate_MCMC_Growth is converted to a dataframe
    and structured using requested quantiles. This function takes the list of MCMC results for multiple
    chains, restructures them into a dataframe and calculates quantiles around length-at-age estimates.
    The quantiles are produced using the tidybayes::mean_qi() function and this result is returned from the function.
    This can be conveniently plotted in a ggplot using the geom_lineribbon() function provided in the tidybayes
    package.
