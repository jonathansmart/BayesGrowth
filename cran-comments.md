## Resubmission

* quotes provided when 'rstan' is mentioned

* doi added to references using angle brackets


## Initial submission

* \donttest{} is used for several function examples as these
  functions run MCMC models and have unavoidably long run times.
  
* Possibly misspelled words in DESCRIPTION have been checked and are correct

* 3 Notes occur via rhub::check_for_cran. An online search suggests that each 
of these occur due to rstan and are not a problem for a cran submission.

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 3 notes

* This is a new release.
